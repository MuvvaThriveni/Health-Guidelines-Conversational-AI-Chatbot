# Advanced LLaMA-2 Chatbot for Data Lakehouse Documentation

This project implements an advanced question-answering system using the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model, designed to understand and 
interact with documentation on Data Lakehouse architectures. By leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques and efficient vector storage, 
the system provides precise, context-aware responses to user queries.

## Features

- **LLaMA-2 Model Integration**: Utilizes the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model for high-quality text generation and understanding.
- **Data Ingestion and Chunking**: Efficiently ingests and processes large volumes of documentation, splitting text into manageable chunks for better model performance.
- **FAISS Vector Store**: Implements FAISS for fast and accurate similarity search, enabling quick retrieval of relevant information.
- **LangChain Integration**: Chains together different components, such as prompts and memory, to enhance the language model's capabilities.
